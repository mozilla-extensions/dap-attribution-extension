// These are my general todo notes to finalize the extension code

// TODO: Clean up CONSOLE.LOGS so Hobert can use those to Demo

// TODO: Make generic, so other tasks / use cases can use this ext??
// Would have to make enum for tasks / get them from http endpoint
// Each task could define, # of measurements/order/type (source/target), send interval, time window for attribution, etc.

//events.js
// handleEvent

    // TODO: need to prevent multiple / fraud events (imp, click, and conversions)
    // TODO: Prevent DDOS?? Retain a cache of key to count for a short interval?

    // TODO: Add any more features outlined in design doc (read again in case you missed something)

    // TODO: Add an exclusion list? source and target lists that are allowed?
        - list will get long though, would need background work to verify/reset events
        - handle verifying events? Could use jwt tokens signed by server? YES and include max counts and timeouts

// handleTargetEvent
